My favorite game is "Rust".It is a surviving simulator where players have to fight for survival in the cruel world of post -apocalypse.You do your best to survive: you collect resources, build structures, fight with other players and explore the vast open world.The game impresses with graphics and a realistic gameplay, which makes it exciting and test.
